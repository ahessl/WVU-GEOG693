#### Little Women Solutions

__Option 1__
```{bash, engine='sh'}
cd ../data/data-shell/writing/data
for sis in Jo Meg Beth Amy
do
	echo $sis:
	grep -ocw $sis LittleWomen.txt
done
```
__Option 2__
```{bash, engine='sh'}
cd ../data/data-shell/writing/data
for sis in Jo Meg Beth Amy
do
	echo $sis:
	grep -ow $sis LittleWomen.txt | wc -l
done
```


Solution #1 is inferior because `grep -c` only reports the number of lines matched. The total number of matches reported by this method will be lower if there is more than one match per line.

Do either include "Amy's"?

What other applications can you imagine for this type of loop?
