### Motivation
Elizabeth has a large number of files from a Hobo weather station.  Some of those files are in Celsius and some are in Fahrenheit.  She needs to convert all of those file to Kelvin.  She thinks an if/else statement is the way to get started.

#### Questions
*	How can I make data-dependent choices in R?
*	How can I repeat operations in R?

#### Objectives
*	Write conditional statements with if() and else().

Often when weâ€™re coding we want to control the flow of our actions. This can be done by setting actions to occur only if a condition or a set of conditions are met. Alternatively, we can also set an action to occur a particular number of times.
There are several ways you can control flow in R. For conditional statements, the most commonly used approaches are the constructs if() and if()...else():  
**if**
```
if (condition is true) {
  perform action
}
```
***if...else***
```
if (condition is true) {
  perform action
} else {  # that is, if the condition is false,
  perform alternative action
}
```

Say, for example, that we want R to print a message if a variable x has a particular value:
```{r}
x <- 8

if (x >= 10) {
  print("x is greater than or equal to 10")
}
```

We get no response in the console because x is not greater than 10! To print a different message for numbers less than 10, we can add an else statement.
```{r}
x <- 8

if (x >= 10) {
  print("x is greater than or equal to 10")
} else {
  print("x is less than 10")
}
```

You can also test multiple conditions by using `else if ()`:  
```{r}
x <- 8

if (x >= 10) {
  print("x is greater than or equal to 10")
} else if (x > 5) {
  print("x is greater than 5, but less than 10")
} else {
  print("x is less than 5")
}
```
Important: when R evaluates the condition inside if() statements, it is looking for a logical element, i.e., TRUE or FALSE. This can cause some headaches for beginners. For example:
```{r}
x  <-  4 == 3
if (x) {
  "4 equals 3"
} else {
  "4 does not equal 3"          
}
```

As we can see, the not equal message was printed because the vector x is FALSE
```{r}
x <- 4 == 3
x
```

>__Challenge__

Use an if() statement to print a suitable message reporting whether there are any records from 2002 in the gapminder dataset. Now do the same for 2012.

*Did anyone get a warning message like this?*
Warning in if (gapminder$year == 2012) {: the condition has length > 1 and
only the first element will be used

If your condition evaluates to a vector with more than one logical element, the function `if()` will still run, but will only evaluate the condition in the first element. Here you need to make sure your condition is of length 1.

#### any() and all()
The any() function will return TRUE if at least one TRUE value is found within a vector, otherwise it will return FALSE. This can be used in a similar way to the %in% operator. The function all(), as the name suggests, will only return TRUE if all values in the vector are TRUE.

```{r}
gapminder <-  read.csv("../data/gapminder.csv")
(any(gapminder$year==2002)) 
```
Can you solve the challenge now?

#### Key Points 
* if() { } - structure of if, then statements  
* else() { }  - structure for multiple alternate options  
* any()  - returns TRUE if any of the elements in a vector are TRUE  
* all()  - returns TRUE only if all of the elements in a vector are TRUE
