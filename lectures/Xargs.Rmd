```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

###Can you add example of xargs here?
`Xargs` is a powerful utility; it can help you pass output of one command as an _argument_ of another command for processing. Let's say you want to find the word count of every file in a directory using a wildcard:

```{bash, echo=-1, eval=T}
cd ../data/data-shell/molecules
ls *ane* | xargs wc
```
Or let's say you have a list of file names for which you want to read the first two lines:

```{bash, echo=-1, eval=T}
cd ../data/data-shell/molecules
ls *ane* | xargs head -n 2 
```

Remember the lengths.txt file? You can use xargs to...
```{bash, echo=-1, eval=T}
cd ../data/data-shell/molecules
xargs -a lengths.txt
```
