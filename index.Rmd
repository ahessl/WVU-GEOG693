Welcome!

New tools and techniques in data science are enabling collaboration and discovery in the Earth and environmental sciences at unprecedented rates and scales.
In this course, students will learn how to:  
  * Rapidly download data from online sources  
  *	Use the terminal to search, organize, and edit files  
  *	Develop a projects, functions, and reports in R  
  *	Wrangle data into the shape you need for analysis  
*	Collaborate online using version control in GitHub   
We will work with data typical of the Earth sciences, but techniques and skills are broadly applicable across fields.  Course will be taught in a workshop setting.  Students will develop projects that simulate real-life collaboration with other scientists.
